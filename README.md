# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analysis ride share across different city types. Matplotlib and Pandas were the only modules used to perform the visual analysis.

## Analysis
After analyzing the two data sets there are significant differences in city types, total rides/drivers and, fare per rides/drivers.

### City Types
Urban had the most fares followed by suburban then rural. This same order of city types is true for number of rides and total drivers. The reverse order is true for average fare for riders and drivers. Urban is the only city type where there are more drivers than rides. Also, Urban is the only city type where the average fare per ride is higher than the average fare per driver indicating profitability.

## Results
Urban is the only profitable city type where average fare per ride is higher than the drivers fare. This is most likely due to the fact there significantly more drivers than rides. My First recommendation is incentivizing some of the urban drivers to go into the suburban and rural areas to a point where there are more drivers than total rides. This would only require around 200 drivers from urban. My second recommendation is to safeguard the urban market. This is the source of more than half your fares. It is important that this city type performs well. My third recommendation is possibly offering rider incentives during the winter months. Total fare revenue dropped off significantly during early January. By offering rider incentives this could boost total fares and rides.
